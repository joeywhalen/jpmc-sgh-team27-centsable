            A large percentage of the U.S. college population is comprised of minority students from various backgrounds and races, including <b> African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanic and Latinos, Asian and Pacific Islanders, and so forth.  </b> 
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>To qualify as minority student,</b> you don't need to be a first generation immigrant or the first person in your family to go to college. Specific organizations qualify women or LGBTQ students as minorities.
