              The term “personal finance” refers to how you manage your money and plan for your future. All of your financial decisions and activities have an effect on your financial health. We are often guided by specific rules of thumb, such as “don’t buy a house that costs more than two-and-a-half years’ worth of income” or “you should always save at least 10% of your income toward retirement.”

              While there's never a bad time to make a financial fresh start, 
              it makes sense to rethink how you're managing your money at the start of a new year.
              "It's a really good time to start a budget, because all your big numbers are coming in," 
              says Jon Brodsky, U.S. CEO of Finder, a comparison website for financial services and products. 
              W-2 and 1099 tax forms compile income information while year-end summaries from credit card issuers such as 
              Chase and Discover make it easy to review annual spending patterns.
